# Ballon d'Or Countdown
As my first personal project in the JavaScript framework course, I have created a countdown timer for this year's Ballon D'or.

# Design
I have chosen a design that I think fits as I believe and hope that it is the GOAT Messi who will win his eighth Ballons d'Or.

The design is taken/inspired from: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1093536402370138409 - Credit to JIBIN S. JOSEPH
